I have trained and tested the code

CUDA 12.1

Python 3.8， Install the required packages through pip install


The code usage process is as follows: training———testing————statistics; Among them, net is the main network, and block is the network backbone Transformer


Download the training and testing datasets for our model. In addition, we provided the results of inhalation research in the original paper.。
